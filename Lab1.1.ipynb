    "- `df.dtypes` - the data types of the each column\n",
    "- `df.columns` - the name of each column\n",
    "- `df.shape` - the number of rows and columns of the dataset\n",
    "- `df.dropna()` - removes null values\n",
    "- `pd.todatetime(...)` - sets a given column to a `datetime` object\n",
    "- `df.column.isunique` - returns True if all data are unique\n",
    "- `df.column.unique()` - returns all of the uniue values of a column\n",
    "- `df['col'].replace(...,...)` - replaces values in a column with another value\n",
    "- `df['col'].value_counts()` - returns the value counts of each unique value\n",
    "- `df['col'].quantile(0.25) or .quartile(0.75) ` - returns the value at 25% or 75% precent    "
